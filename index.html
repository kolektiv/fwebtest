          <h1>Functional</h1>
          <p>Freya is an F# web stack, offering a powerful, typed approach to web development on the CLR. Functional-first, Freya takes an approach to web programming that plays to the strengths of functional programming, designed from the ground up to be consistent and understandable.</p>

          <h1>Powerful</h1>
          <p>Freya gives you strong tools to build accurate and compliant web systems, from typed access to HTTP (on top of OWIN), to machine-style resource builders, to fast and capable routing. And when Freya doesn't have a tool in the box, it's a great platform for building new tools and new layers &mdash; integrating new functionality with Freya is elegant and straightforward.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>Open Source</h1>
          <p>Freya is a genuinely open source project. All development is done in public (and pull requests are welcomed), we're open and communicative about the roadmap, and we listen to anyone that wants to use Freya. We do everything we can to make Freya a good choice.</p>
